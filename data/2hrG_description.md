The 2hr glucose datasets were generated by a meta-analysis of nine GWAS in 15,234 non-diabetic individuals and a
follow-up of 29 independent loci in 6,958-30,620 individuals. Trait values for 2hr glucose are untransformed and
are adjusted for BMI in addition to age, sex and study-specific covariates.
